	I will look back very fondly at my time as a member of the Robotics and Controls group at Notre Dame. This dissertation is more than the result of my own work; it also reflects the stimulating conversations I have had with many exceptional people whom I wish to acknowledge.
	
	First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge my advisor Dr. Patrick Wensing for his guidance, support, patience, and commitment to helping his students succeed. Pat has pushed me to sharpen my skills and has helped me elevate the quality of my work. Through his mentorship, I have become a better researcher and a better person. I will miss working in the ROAM Lab, dearly.
	
	I am also thankful to my doctoral committee members. Thank you to Dr. Jim Schmiedeler, Dr. Bill Goodwine, and Dr. Edgar Bolivar-Nieto for their support and valuable, thought-provoking feedback on my work that has helped me broaden my research perspectives. 
	
	I would also like to thank my friends and labmates at Notre Dame: John Nganga, Mitchell Lozier, Taylor Higgins, Chris Higgins, Gabriel Bravo-Palacios, David Kelly, Omar Rasheed, Ryan Posh, He Li, Shenggao Li, Martin Fevre, Myia Dickens, Balark Tiwari, Aravind Baskar, Jack Liu, Cody Cochran, Velena Hernandez, Ciera McFarland, and Katalin Sch{\"a}ffer. 
	
	Most importantly, I would like to thank my family. This would not have been possible without their unconditional love and unwavering support. I will be forever grateful to them.
