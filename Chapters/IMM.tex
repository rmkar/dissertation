\chapter{Model-based Approach to Estimate Gait Characteristics} \label{chapter:IMM}
Accurate state estimation is a foundational component for user intent estimation in HRI as it would deliver increased insight into user actions. This chapter describes and estimation framework (Fig.~\ref{fig:IMM_overview}) that employs a library of gaits generated from a template model. This library is compared to sensor measurements from an exoskeleton to estimate gait speed and characteristics. The library contains walking gaits with speeds up to 1 m/s, and is built using a predictor-corrector-type gait search algorithm to address the low dynamic stability of the model at low speeds. The library gaits are then compared to measurements from the exoskeleton using Interacting Multi-Model (IMM) to fuse estimates from multiple parallel EKFs (Chapter~\ref{chapter:bg_info}). While IMMs have been used for intent estimation for reaching actions \cite{chaandar2015human}, their application to legged locomotion has been limited to state estimation between stance and flight phases of robot gaits~\cite{skaff2005context, pace2020stepping}, i.e, two parallel EKFs. The framework presented herein compares human gait data and template model gaits to estimate the CoM state as the exoskeleton transitions through different gait phases.

The target population of this work is individuals with iSCIs, so the gait velocities of interest are very small in magnitude ($ \sim $ 0.5 m/s) \cite{nymark2005electromyographic}. There is limited work that uses physics-based models as a fundamental component in intent detection. The main attraction of using physics-based models is to allow for the accommodation of a greater number of users by modifying a small set of parameters such as mass, leg length, angles, and stiffness. The work described in this chapter uses the 3D B-SLIP model \cite{liu2015dynamic} as the basis of an estimation framework.

There are often physical changes to the gait as a result of changes in intended velocity, such as changes in step frequency, step length, and CoM trajectories \cite{kuo2001simple}. As introduced in Chapter~\ref{chapter:bg_info}, template models emulate the salient characteristics of legged locomotion such as CoM trajectories and ground reaction force (GRF) profiles~\cite{mochon1980ballistic}. Therefore, they may also emulate the changes in CoM trajectories and step length corresponding to changes in intent. The purpose of the estimation framework described herein is to estimate gait characteristics such as gait phase and velocity of an exoskeleton user. This estimation is achieved through the comparison of the subject's CoM trajectory, estimated using sensor measurements from the exoskeleton, to CoM trajectories for various gaits of a model of bipedal locomotion, specifically the B-SLIP model.

While the work described herein considers forward speed as the representation of the user's intent, it is not the only modality of intent representation. Other aspects of intent not considered herein are the user's desires to initiate/terminate gait, change heading, and change gait mode, i.e., transitions from walking on flat ground to ramps or stairs. In theory, the presented IMM estimation framework may be extended to all these scenarios, with appropriate models of locomotion e.g., the B-SLIP can describe steady-state gaits, but not gait initiation/termination. Considering multiple aspects of intent change for estimation at once may present difficulties as they may influence the gait differently and complicate the estimation problem via crosstalk. Considering only the gait speed as a starting point helps break the estimation problem into a smaller subsection and reduces the challenges faced during estimation.

The challenges faced during estimation were the increased difficulty in finding low-speed periodic gaits during gait library generation and handling the hybrid dynamics of legged locomotion used to describe the different gait phases. The work done to address these challenges is described in this chapter. The gait optimization setup used to find periodic B-SLIP gaits is described in Section~\ref{sec:gait_opt}. A linearization-based seed search method was developed to search for gaits at low walking speeds (less than 0.8 m/s) and generate a gait library as described in Section~\ref{sec:gait_lib}. Additionally, IMM estimation was used to handle hybrid dynamics along with the library gaits as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:IMM}. The performance of this framework was evaluated on experimental data of exoskeleton walking trials and is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:IMM_results}. The challenges associated with implementing this framework for human data and the insights gained from the evaluation are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:challenges}, and a summary is provided in Section~\ref{sec:IMM_summary}. This chapter describes the results reported in a previous conference publication \cite{karulkarapplication}.

\section{Generating the gait library using the B-SLIP model} \label{sec:gait_opt}

Qualitative differences in the CoM trajectories of humans walking at different speeds were observed in experimental data \cite{fukuchi2018public}. Namely, the vertical and lateral excursion of the CoM over each step decrease and increase, respectively, as gait velocity decreases. It was hypothesized that gait parameters may be estimated based on the changes in CoM trajectories. The 3D B-SLIP model presents a balance between model simplicity and CoM trajectory emulation. Additionally, using the 3D B-SLIP model allows the modeling of two important attributes of walking at low speeds: the lateral CoM movement that becomes increasingly dominant as gait velocity decreases, and the DS period that represents a majority of the gait cycle. As the B-SLIP is a passive model, the omission of an actuator simplifies the estimation problem by reducing the assumptions necessary while applying these models to human walking. 

As described in Section~\ref{sec:bslip_model}, the state vector representing the CoM is \[\x_{c} = \left[x_{c} ,y_{c} ,z_{c} ,\dot{x}_{c} ,\dot{y}_{c} ,\dot{z}_{c}\right]^T \] The input parameters of the model, leg angles and stiffness, along with components of the initial \com~ state, are collected in a parameter vector \[\greekvec{\xi} = [\phi, \theta ,k ,z_{0_{c}} ,y_{0_{c}} ,\dot{x}_{0_{c}}]^T\] Here, $ \theta $ and $ \phi $ are leg angles that govern step length and width, and variables $ z_{0_{c}}$, $y_{0_{c}}$, and $\dot{x}_{0_{c}} $ give the vertical position, lateral position, and forward velocity of the CoM relative to the stance foot at the beginning of the step. An optimization procedure was carried out to find the parameters that would yield a fixed point for an MS-to-MS Poincar\'e map.

\subsection{Gait optimization}

%	\input{Chapters/IMM_cost.tex}
%\end{table}
%%

The gait library used in the estimation framework is a collection of several B-SLIP gaits, so a procedure to generate these gaits must first established. The B-SLIP model is passive, so a gait optimization procedure was carried out considering the state evolution over one step to generate periodic gaits that qualitatively match human walking. The gait optimization was considered via a nonlinear programming problem
%
\begin{eqnarray}
	\min_{\greekvec{\xi}}& \quad \lVert{\mat{J}(\greekvec{\xi})}\rVert ^2 + (k_{max} - k) \label{eq:gaitOpt}\\
	\textrm{s.t.}& \quad \vec{g}(\greekvec{\xi}) \leq \epsilon \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $ \mat{J}(\greekvec{\xi}) $ was a vector-valued function returning four terms. The first term is the vertical excursion of the CoM, i.e, the distance over one step between the CoM height at MS and the lowest point in the CoM trajectory at Mid-Double-Support (MDS), $ (z_{0_{CoM}} - z_{MDS}) $. This term was included to flatten the CoM trajectory in the sagittal plane and ensure resemblance to CoM trajectories seen in humans. Additionally, the deviations of the simulated step length and width from the desired values $ (l_{step_{des}} - l_{step}) $ and $ (w_{step_{des}} - w_{step}) $, respectively, were included in $ \mat{J}(\greekvec{\xi}) $ to better emulate human walking. The distance from the ground projection of the CoM to the foot at MS $ (y_{0_{CoM}} - y_{foot_A}) $ was also included in $ \mat{J}(\greekvec{\xi}) $. This distance was penalized to encourage more lateral excursion during SS1. In the B-SLIP model, the mass loaded onto the spring leg is essentially in free-fall during SS1. Ensuring its ground projection at the initial position is close to the position of the stance foot results in greater lateral excursion over the following step. The increased lateral excursion was further encouraged by driving leg stiffness toward an upper limit with the inclusion of $ (k_{max} - k) $ in the cost.

The desired step length and width components of the cost were found to be critical for the convergence of the optimization. Step length $ l_{step} $ and width $ w_{step} $ depend on gait speed \cite{andriacchi1977walking}. These quantities were approximated as polynomial functions of the target gait velocity $ v_x $, with initial CoM height as a proxy for leg length, such that
\begin{eqnarray}
	l_{step} &=& [1\ v_x\ v_x^2\ z_{0_{c}} v_x] \greekvec{\gamma}_l \\
	w_{step} &=& [1\ v_x\ v_x^2\ z_{0_{c}} v_x] \greekvec{\gamma}_w
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $ \greekvec{\gamma}_l $ and $ \greekvec{\gamma}_w $ are the coefficient vectors for step length and width, respectively, computed by fitting to human walking data of people under the age of 40 for treadmill and overground walking. The RMS errors for these polynomial fits were approximately 3 cm for both step length and width. These errors were lower than the standard deviations of the measured data, which were 9.7 cm and 3.4 cm, respectively.
%
%Nonlinear constraint functions $ \vec{g}(\greekvec{\xi}) $ ensured the periodicity of the gait by matching the initial and final positions and velocities of the CoM with respect to the trailing foot to a tolerance $ \epsilon $. These constraints matched the distance of CoM ground projection to foot at MS
%\[
%	(x_{foot_A} - x_{f_{CoM}})^2 
%\]
%the initial and final forward velocity of the CoM,
%\[
%	(\dot{x}_{0_{CoM}} - \dot{x}_{f_{CoM}} )^2
%\]
%the initial and final vertical velocity of the CoM,
%\[
%	(z_{0_{CoM}} - z_{f_{CoM}})^2
%\]
%and ensured that the CoM has no lateral velocity at MS.
%\[
%	\dot{y}_{f_{CoM}}^2
%\]

Nonlinear constraint functions $ \vec{g}(\greekvec{\xi}) $ ensured the periodicity of the gait by matching the initial and final positions and velocities of the CoM with respect to the trailing foot to a tolerance $ \epsilon $. The first term in $ \vec{g} $ was constructed to limit the distance of CoM ground projection to the foot at MS $ (x_{foot_A} - x_{f_{c}})^2  $. The second and third terms were constructed to limit the difference between the initial and final forward velocity of the CoM $ (\dot{x}_{0_{c}} - \dot{x}_{f_{c}} )^2 $ and the initial and final vertical velocity of the CoM $ (z_{0_{c}} - z_{f_{c}})^2 $, respectively. The fourth term was constructed to limit the CoM lateral velocity at MS $ \dot{y}_{f_{c}}^2 $.

As speed decreased, it was progressively difficult to choose appropriate parameters to seed the optimization, as the sensitivity of the model to initial conditions increased due to low passive stability at low speeds \cite{kuo2001simple}. This was an important challenge to overcome, as gait speeds during rehabilitation are low \cite{seethapathi2015metabolic}. A predictor-corrector scheme was applied to start at a high-speed gait and compute appropriate seeds for low-speed gaits. 

\subsection{Linearization-based seed search}\label{sec:gait_lib}

Empirically, gaits at speeds greater than 0.8 m/s for the B-SLIP could be found directly through optimization of \eqref{eq:gaitOpt} without special attention to initial seeds. A predictor-corrector strategy (Fig.~\ref{fig:homotopy}) was employed to address the challenges for lower velocities. In this strategy, an MS-to-MS Poincar\'e return map (described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:bg_info}) was linearized and used to solve for a preliminary seed during a homotopy process toward a lower-speed gait. This map is described by
%
\begin{equation}
	\x_{k+1} = \mathcal{P}(\x_k ,\u_k)
\end{equation}
%
where $\x_k$ denotes the state at MS and $\u_k$ denotes the discrete controls applied over one step as given by $ \x = \left[y_c ,z_c ,\dot{x}_c ,\dot{y}_c\right]^T $ and $ \mathbf{u} = \left[\phi ,\theta ,k\right]^T $.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{homotopy.eps}
	\caption{Illustration of the linearization-based predictor-corrector search scheme to find periodic low-speed gaits}\label{fig:homotopy}
\end{figure}

The B-SLIP model is passive, as the controls $ \u $ are constant for each gait. At MS, the vertical velocity satisfies $\dot{z}=0$, as specified by the guard condition described in \eqref{eq:gms}. Thus, $\dot{z}$ is omitted from the state $\x_k$ on the Poincar\'e surface. Following the optimization of one step of a periodic gait with state and control $\x^*_k$, $\u^*_k$, the return map is linearized, providing
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearized}
	\x_{k+1} \approx \x_{k+1}^* + \underbrace{\left.\frac{\partial \mathcal{P}}{\partial \x}\right|_{\x^*_k, \u^*_k}}_{:=\A} \delta \x_k + \underbrace{\left. \frac{\partial \mathcal{P}}{\partial \u}\right|_{\x^*_k, \u^*_k}}_{:=\B} \delta \u_k 
\end{equation}
%
where $\x_{k+1}^* = \mathcal{P}(\x_k^*, \u_k^*)$, $\delta \x_k = \x_k - \x^*_k$, and $\delta \u_k = \u_k - \u^*_k$. Since a gait of the 3D B-SLIP model is two-step periodic, left/right symmetry from step to step requires that $\x_{k+1}^* = \mathbf{S} \x_k^*$, where $\mathbf{S} = {\rm diag}([-1, 1, 1, 1])$. This matrix encodes that only the $y$-position (lateral position) of the CoM relative to the foot must change signs from step to step. Then, to solve for an approximate state/control pair for a lower-speed gait, variations to the parameters were found such that $\delta \x_{k+1} = \mathbf{S} \delta \x_k $. This constraint requires
\begin{align}\label{eq:linEq}
	\mathbf{0} = (\A-\mathbf{S})\delta \x_k + \B\delta \u_k\,. 
\end{align}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{subplot.pdf}
	\vspace{-1em}
	\caption{A subset of the CoM trajectories in the gait library after optimization.}\label{fig:library}
\end{figure}

To generate a suitable next seed, the forward velocity component of $ \delta \x_k$ was held constant to the desired change in velocity. Considering \eqref{eq:linEq}, these equations provide 4 constraints for the 6 remaining unknowns, $ \left[\delta y_\com,\ \delta z_\com,\ \delta\dot{y}_\com,\ \delta \phi,\, \delta \theta,\, \delta k\right]^T  $, resulting in 2 degrees of freedom. Perturbations $\delta \x_k$ and $\delta \u_k$ satisfying these equations were computed with a least-norm solution, and the resulting parameters were used to seed the next gait optimization. This homotopy process was repeated until the desired low-velocity gait was optimized, resulting in a library of gaits for a range of speeds. Two libraries were generated: one at 0.4\,m/s - 0.9\,m/s for use with B-SLIP data and another at 0.6\,m/s - 1.0\,m/s for use with exoskeleton measurements, both at increments of 0.1\,m/s. As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:library}, generated libraries qualitatively exhibit the vertical and lateral CoM excursion trends that are observed in human data. That is, vertical excursion decreases, and lateral excursion increases with a decrease in forward velocity. This linearization-based gait search method makes the generation of low-speed gaits easier and yields a library that serves as the basis for the IMM estimator outlined in the next section.

\section{Interacting Multi-Model estimation} \label{sec:IMM}

	\caption{IMM scheme used to estimate gait phase and walking speed.}\label{fig:IMM}
\end{figure}
The IMM is a technique to  adaptively fuse estimates from multiple filters, running in parallel. Despite their use in other hybrid systems (\cite{bar2005imm},\cite{daeipour1998imm}), the application of IMMs to legged locomotion has been minimal. One example is the use of IMMs for legged locomotion is in state estimation and gait phase prediction for RHex \cite{skaff2005context}, a six-legged robot with compliant legs. Gait phase estimation is possible by directly using force
sensors in the exoskeleton soles \cite{agostini2013segmentation,de2012gait}. However, by relating human data to template models, the presented approach may provide insight into unmeasured parameters, such as leg stiffness, and the effects of changes in them on the gait. While the current presentation aims to be self contained, the interested reader is referred to \cite{Crassidis}.

The IMM estimation process used in this work is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:IMM}. Each of the $M$ filters represents a different candidate gait and phase, and the IMM attempts to determine which of the phases is most likely. 
In what follows, $ i $ and $ j $ index over filters, and $ k$ indexes over time. There are two types of estimate interactions shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:IMM}. First, a likelihood-based mixing produces an ensemble estimate output from the IMM, while a Markov mixing relates the state estimates from the filters at time step $k$ to the initial estimates at time step $k+1$. 

The filters begin with initial state estimates $\fsup{\xh_k^0}{j}$ and covariances $\fsup{\P_k^0}{j}$ that are propagated forward to $\fsup{\xh_k^-}{j}$ and $\fsup{\P_k^-}{j}$ using the B-SLIP dynamics presented in \eqref{eq:sysProp} and~\eqref{eq:covProp}. Measurements from the system whose state is being estimated, in this case, measurements from the exoskeleton sensors, are used to initialize the filter at start-up, and the covariance is set to be an identity matrix. Measurements from the sensors are represented by $ \yt_k $, and these may be reconstructed using the estimated state with the measurement function $  \h\left( \fsup{\xh_k^-}{j}\right) $. The error between these two quantities is known as the measurement residual given by $ \fsup{\e_k}{j} = \yt_k - \h\left( \fsup{\xh_k^-}{j}\right)$. The measurement likelihood ${}^j  \ell_k$ is then calculated for the state estimate of each filter as
\begin{align} \label{eq:likelihood}
	{}^j \ell_k &= p(\yt_k|\fsup{\xh_k^-}{j})  = {\rm det}( 2 \pi \fsup{\E_k}{j})^{-1/2} \,  {e}^{\lambda_r} \,~\textrm{where}\\[.5ex]
	\lambda_r &= -\frac{1}{2}\ {}^j\e_k^T \, \fsup{\E_k^{-1}}{j} \, \fsup{\e_k}{j} \nonumber
\end{align}
and $ \fsup{\E_k}{j} $ denotes the covariance of the measurement residual given by \[\fsup{\E_k}{j} = \fsup{\H_k}{j}\ \fsup{\P_k^{-}}{j}\ \fsup{\H_k^T}{j} + \fsup{\R_k}{j}\] with $\fsup{\H_k}{j}$ the Jacobian of the measurement function $ \h $ at $\fsup{\xh_k^-}{j}$.

The measurement likelihood is then normalized across the $M$ models to calculate model weights $\fsup{w_k}{j}$ via
\begin{eqnarray}
	\fsup{w_k}{j} =  \frac{\fsup{ \ell_k}{j}}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{M} \fsup{ \ell_k}{i}}  \label{eq:weightCalc}
\end{eqnarray}
The magnitude of the weight $\fsup{w_k}{j}$ indicates the relative confidence of the filter that the system is in mode $j$ at time step $k$. In a conventional IMM approach \cite{Crassidis}, model weights for the current iteration are computed by weighting the likelihood with weights from the previous iteration such that $\fsup{w_k}{j} = \fsup{w_{k-1}}{j} {}^j \ell_k$ before being normalized, to discount models previously found to be unlikely. In contrast, the weights from the previous iteration are not included in \eqref{eq:weightCalc}. This change was due to the fact that due to the periodic hybrid dynamics of the B-SLIP model, some likelihoods, e.g., likelihoods for DS models during SS, result in numerically zero weights, from which it is not possible to recover to non-zero weights.

Following the computation of the likelihood for each model, the noisy measurement $\yt_k$ is used with the Kalman update in \eqref{eq:kalmanGain},\eqref{eq:ekfStateUp}, and \eqref{eq:ekfCovUp} to produce \textit{a~posteriori} estimates $\fsup{\x_k^+}{j}$ and covariances $\fsup{\P_k^+}{j}$. These quantities are fused to produce an ensemble estimate $\xh_k$ with covariance $\P_k$ calculated via
\begin{eqnarray}
	\xh_k &=& \displaystyle \sum_{j =1}^{M} \fsup{w_k}{j} \fsup{\xh_k^{+}}{j} \label{eq:estimates} \\
	\P_k &=& \displaystyle \sum_{j =1}^{M} \fsup{w_k}{j}  \left[\left(\fsup{\xh_k^{+}}{j} - \xh_k\right) \left(\fsup{\xh_k^{+}}{j} - \xh_k\right)^T + \fsup{\P_k^{+}}{j} \right] \label{eq:covFuse}
\end{eqnarray}
Fusion from \eqref{eq:covFuse} captures the covariance of each individual filter and of each filter estimate with the fused estimate.

Initial conditions for the next time step $\fsup{\xh_{k+1}^{0}}{j}$ are then computed considering interaction between the models as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:updatex}
	\fsup{\xh_{k+1}^{0}}{j} &= \displaystyle \sum_{i =1}^{M} \fsup{w_k}{(i|j)} \fsup{\xh_k^{+}}{i}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $ \fsup{w_k}{(i|j)} $ is a weight that considers a likelihood-based model probability and a Markov-based transition probability from model $ i $ to model $ j $. Markov transition probabilities $ p_{ij} $ are specified as fixed probabilities of switching from $ i $ to $ j $ and the weights are computed as
\begin{eqnarray}
	\fsup{w_k}{(i|j)} = \frac{\fsup{w_k}{i} p_{ij}}{\displaystyle \sum_{s = 1}^{M}\fsup{w_k}{s} p_{s j} } \label{eq:markov}
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly, a mixed covariance for the next iteration is computed through
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:updateP}
	\fsup{\P_{k+1}^{0}}{j} &=& \sum_{i =1}^{M} \fsup{w_k}{(i|j)} \left[ \fsup{\mathbf{e}_k}{(i|j)} \fsup{\mathbf{e}^{T}_k}{(i|j)} + \fsup{\P_k^{+}}{i} \right]\,,~ \textrm{where}\\[.5ex]
	\fsup{\mathbf{e}_k}{(i|j)} &=& \fsup{\xh_k^{+}}{i} - \fsup{\xh_{k+1}^{0}}{j} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{likeCompare.pdf}
	\caption{The effects of the inclusion of physical likelihood on phase likelihoods}\label{fig:likeCompare}
\end{figure}

A small modification to the conventional IMM was necessary to enable the framework to correctly identify gait modes. 
The likelihood calculation \eqref{eq:likelihood} only looks at the measurement residual, which can be misleading. Dynamics during DS can track the CoM trajectories from SS data by allowing legs to extend beyond their free length, which is not physically possible. A physical likelihood term $ \lambda_p $ was added to the likelihood calculation to address this observation. This strategy takes into account the difference $\Delta l$ between the rest length and current length of the leg, which should remain positive. The likelihood is then modified as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:physicalLikelihood}
	{}^j \ell_k &=& {\rm det}(2 \pi \fsup{\E_k}{j})^{-1/2}\   e^{\lambda_r + \lambda_p}\,,~\textrm{where} \\[.5ex]
	\lambda_p &=& -\kappa \min(0,\Delta l)^2  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
and $ \kappa>0$ is a tuning parameter. In DS, the leg with the minimum value for $\Delta l$ is used to compute $\lambda_p$.
This approach decreases the weight of a model if its estimated leg length is greater than its rest length. Figure \ref{fig:likeCompare} shows the effect this modification has on phase inference. With the change, the likelihood of DS only rises during the true DS phase, illustrated with the shaded area. The rate at which the likelihood of DS rises and decays can be tuned using $ \kappa $. With these modifications, the IMM framework can be set up to adequately identify the appropriate dynamics, SS or DS, to be used for state estimation at a given time.

The IMM framework was first evaluated on synthetic data from simulated B-SLIP gaits, and the results are described in Section~\ref{sec:IMM_syn}. The framework was then evaluated on data from a healthy user walking in the exoskeleton using a walker, and the results are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:IMM_human}.

\subsection{Testing with B-SLIP simulation data}\label{sec:IMM_syn}

The B-SLIP gait used to generate synthetic measurements was from the library with a forward velocity $ \dot{x}_c $ = 0.7 m/s. Measurements of the 3D position and forward, and vertical velocity of the CoM in the sagittal plane were used in this implementation of the IMM such that $ \y = [x_{c},\ y_{c},\ z_{c},\ \dot{x}_{c},\ \dot{z}_{c}]^T $. Zero-mean Gaussian noise with constant covariance $ \R $ was added to the simulated measurements. Process noise was not added to the simulation. However, the process noise covariance $ \Q $ was retained as an estimation parameter as inaccuracies in the dynamics exist when an inaccurate gait/phase is used during estimation. The covariance values used are given by
\begin{align}
	\R &= {\rm diag}([5 ,5 ,5  ,50 ,50]) 
\times 10^{-5} \\
\Q &={\rm diag}([0,0,0,1,1,1])
\times 10^{-2}
\end{align}
where continuous process noise variances for positions and velocities are reported with units m${}^2$/s${}^2$ and m${}^2$/s${}^4$, respectively, and discrete measurement variances for positions and velocities are reported with units m${}^2 $ and m${}^2$/s${}^2$, respectively.

	\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{2StepSynth.pdf}
	\caption{Model weights output by the IMM framework applied to measurements generated from a simulation of the B-SLIP model.}\label{fig:weightSyn}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:weightSyn} shows the weights associated with each model over two estimation cycles. The gait used to generate the measurements was excluded from the estimation library. The estimator selected the gait at $ \dot{x}_c $ = 0.6 m/s to be the most likely, as the gait that exactly matched the measurements was absent from the library. The CoM trajectories of the library gaits were similar to each other in SS1; therefore, the estimator had difficulty distinguishing between them. As the gait progressed through DS, the differences in trajectories became more apparent and the estimator was able to identify the most likely gait. This may be explained by the B-SLIP model's effectiveness at describing the DS gait phase in contrast to rigid pendular models that assume an instantaneous transfer of support.

\subsection{Testing with exoskeleton data}\label{sec:IMM_human}

The estimation framework was then tested on data acquired from the sensors onboard the EksoGT exoskeleton during walking trials of an able-bodied person. The subject had a leg length of 0.95 m, weighed 67 kg, and walked at a self-selected speed between 0.6-0.7 m/s using crutches \cite{gambon2019characterizing}. The exoskeleton allows movement only in the sagittal plane and restricts movements in the lateral direction; however, some lateral movement of the CoM is observed due to torso roll. In addition to all the available measurements listed in Sec.~\ref{sec:exoData}, the exoskeleton also reports the estimated height and fore/aft position of the CoM in the global frame. The position of the CoM was approximated and collected in the measurement vector $ \yt = [x_c ,y_c ,z_c]^T $. The evolution of the CoM state of the B-SLIP is sensitive to changes in the leg length of library gaits, particularly in the vertical direction. To address this aspect, the parameters that defined the library gaits were rescaled with respect to the estimated CoM height of the exoskeleton user at the initial MS of the estimator trial. This sensitivity made gait search at lower speeds challenging and as a result, the the velocities of library gaits spanned from 1.0 m/s to 0.6 m/s. Additionally, the following anisotropic process and measurement noise covariances were selected.
\begin{align}
		\R &= {\rm diag}([5,5,0.5])\times 10^{-6} \\
		\Q &={\rm diag}([0,0,0,1,1,10])\times 10^{-2}
\end{align}
This covariance mitigates sensitivity by increasing the estimator's reliance on measurements and decreasing the reliance on the model when inferring vertical CoM evolution. This strategy was found to yield more accurate velocity estimates compared to isotropic covariance selection.

The most likely gaits for one step of the walking trial are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:exoWeights}; higher weights indicate a more likely gait. All lines are color-coded to represent the speeds of the library gaits. Solid lines, dashed lines with cross markers, and solid lines with circular markers indicate the weights for filters representing SS1, DS, and SS2, respectively. The weight for the filter with the most likely phase and speed should have the highest value. 

The user was walking at a velocity between 0.6-0.7 m/s, so the gaits at those speeds are shown to be most likely. All library gaits qualitatively matched human data, i.e., maximum forward velocity was achieved during DS, and lateral velocity was zero at the end of the step. However, the initial and lateral positions were optimization variables when generating the gait library, and as a result, they do not match the initial position in the measured data. Therefore, estimates of CoM velocities, none of which had direct measurements, took $ \approx $50 ms to stabilize to expected behavior, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:exoState} where estimates are plotted along with measured values. The DS period, illustrated in gray, was determined when foot-mounted force sensors indicated both feet were flat on the ground.

\end{figure}

The estimator relies on differences between the measured CoM trajectories and simulated CoM trajectories from library gaits to infer gait phase and speed. Figure 10 illustrates that while the exoskeleton user was walking at a speed between 0.6 m/s and 0.7 m/s, the CoM trajectory in the sagittal plane matches more closely with the library gait at a speed of 1.0 m/s, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:compare}. This behavior may be due to the dynamics of walking in an exoskeleton with an ambulatory device that are not emulated by the B-SLIP model. Despite the mismatch in CoM trajectories, the IMM framework was able to identify the library gait and phase that best matched the user's measured gait speed over a majority of the step, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:exoWeights}. This identification is evidenced by weights for DS and SS2 filters increasing and decreasing according to the estimated phase. The library contains gaits at 0.6 m/s and 0.7 m/s, which are indicated as most likely in Fig.~\ref{fig:exoWeights}, as the user's actual gait velocity was between those two values. Thus, the IMM framework functions as expected, but relies on accurate emulation of CoM trajectories from library gaits for accurate estimation.

\end{figure}

Inaccuracies in the likelihoods of some phases were observed around phase transitions and can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:weightSyn} and Fig.~\ref{fig:exoWeights}. This behavior is an artifact of the variety of the gait library. Computation of the physical likelihood depends on the leg length, which is the same across all library gaits. However, each of these gaits has a different step length as the gait velocities are different. As a result, the durations of the DS phases for each of these gaits is also different. Therefore, even with the leg length rescaling, the discrepancy between the human data and library gaits causes the likelihood function to detect DS and infer the end of SS1 at different times, which causes differences in likelihood switching times. The combined state estimates of the CoM positions are still accurate to within 1cm of the measurements despite this (Fig.~\ref{fig:exoState}).

\section{Challenges with using IMMs} \label{sec:challenges}

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{trajDiff}
	\caption{CoM trajectories for two steps of the same subject walking at steady-state with a self-selected gait speed using a walker vs. crutches.}\label{fig:trajDiff}
\end{figure}
Discrepancies were observed between the measured CoM trajectories and those of B-SLIP gaits. The measured CoM trajectories are asymmetric, and it is difficult to generate high-fidelity matching B-SLIP gaits. Center-of-mass trajectories are influenced by a variety of factors, such as the choice of ambulatory device, and gait features such as gait speed and individual joint trajectories resulting from uncoordinated limb movements. Figure~\ref{fig:trajDiff} shows the CoM trajectories of the same subject over two steps walking at steady-state using a walker and crutches. The step length and therefore, step duration, were shorter when the walker was being used, resulting in considerably different trajectories. This variation in trajectories is challenging to capture using only the B-SLIP model, and simply increasing the number of gaits considered by the IMM is an insufficient solution. Increasing the number of gaits in the library implies an increased number of the gait models being considered may be irrelevant to the user's actual gait; this increased mismatch between the library gaits and measured trajectory may degrade the ensemble estimate.

The ensemble estimate as calculated by the IMM (\ref{eq:estimates}) is a weighted summation of estimates from the filter library. As all gaits in the gait library are intended to match human walking, the likelihoods of the corresponding estimates will rarely go to zero. Therefore, the more gaits there are in the library, the more ``polluted" the ensemble estimate will be due to irrelevant estimates being included. The implementation of the physical likelihood in \eqref{eq:physicalLikelihood} mitigates this issue between gait phases, but it does not address this issue when dealing with different filters of the same phase. A similar problem of context-based estimator selection and its scalability was addressed for legged robots by deactivating and reactivating individual filters \cite{skaff2010context} based on measurements from sensors onboard the robot. However, this approach may not address the variability observed in human walking.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:IMM_summary}
This chapter has shown that the IMM framework is capable of estimating an exoskeleton user's intended gait speed and phase by comparing measured CoM trajectories of exoskeleton users to simulated B-SLIP gaits. The  quality of these estimates is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying gait library, as the estimation relies solely on matching CoM trajectories. Changes in the individual gait variables add up to influence CoM trajectory. It may not always be possible to predict these changes with a simple template model such as the B-SLIP; therefore, the IMM framework may be used as a high-level framework that may be supplemented by another estimator to monitor the individual gait features that affect CoM trajectories. The reactive nature of this framework may also be addressed by considering these gait features and relating them to changes in gait velocity as presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:BKF}.
